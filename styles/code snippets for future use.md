<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
  <img src="./images/Me.jpg" alt="Me" />
  Thank you for taking some time to look into my resume. My name is Rafael
  Garcia, and I’m currently working towards my bachelor’s in computer science at
  the University of Texas at El Paso. I’m about to enter my Junior year and I’m
  very excited about the new knowledge that I will acquire.
  <br /><br />
  At the moment, I possess multiple technical skills that you may find valuable
  assets for the multiple projects you are working with. I am currently able to
  handle proficiently Java, HTML, CSS, especially with Sass. I currently possess
  some basic to intermediate level knowledge of JavaScript, Python, MATLAB, and
  C. In order to improve my abilities with such technologies I have developed
  some projects. An example of these include a program that reads numbers from a
  list in a text file, processes some calculations, like minimum value, maximum
  value, and mean variance, and displays the results in a HTML table in Java.
  Other projects include the testing of the efficiency of multiple sorting and
  searching algorithms, a calculator in JavaScript, and a pomodoro clock.
</p>
<p>
  On top of my technical skills, my work background has provided me with useful
  professional skills. Some of these include being responsible, a fast learner,
  a good team worker, a good observer, and a problem solver. In the project that
  I applied these skills the most was the calculator. Here I had to make sure to
  make time in my schedule to complete the project as fast as possible, and I
  was able to grasp the concepts easily. I was able to catch details from my
  code that could create some problems or did not work as intended, and even if
  I was following instructions in order to learn the language, I had to debug
  some issues that the code was giving me. I also decided to make this project
  with some friends from my major,in order to practice developing
  collaboratively.
</p>
<p>
  I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I would really appreciate
  working at your company. I believe my skills will be a valuable asset to the
  industry. I hope to hear from you soon.
</p>
